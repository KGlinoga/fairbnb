## About

This project is meant to demonstrate relative proficiency in React.js, and the other abovementioned technologies. 
I used a Scrimba tutorial about React.js as a guide, but I coded this entire page from scratch.

The experience cards are populated from an array file named "data", and are displayed via props and the .map array method.  

I do not own any of the images, assets, brands, logos or names on this site, and no infringement is intended.  Please contact me via email for credit/removal (KGlinoga@gmail.com) 

Thanks so much for looking! As of this posting (November 2022), I am actively looking for work so please get in touch for work opportunities!

Best, 
Kristina Glinoga
